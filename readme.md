# inao's bot v2. Built on Discord Bot Base Project 3  (DBBP3)

## Why rewrite?
Well, my old bot was using older base, much older than I'd like to use. So I've decided to write a completely new one. This base should be transferable between multiple Java projects, meaning it's not only Javacord-specific built. No. While it's using some features, these features used outside the base itself. Meaning the base is providing you with an actual base logic that you might actually use to develop your stuff.

## Features.
DBBP3 is trying to use and somehow copy ideas of CDI. This means this base is able to inject by annotation, you are able to introduce Stateful and Stateless "lentils" (read Beans if you wish)

## License and usage
License is being covered in the LICENSE file. By using any of the code, you're agreeing to the license. If you don't agree, don't use this code. You can (and most probably will) face the consequences if you don't fulfill the license.

## Performance
Performance is a huge concern (amongst many others). So I'm always trying to make the bot and base faster, clearer and better in general.

Here are some performance measurements of the bot itself.
